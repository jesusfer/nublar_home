Worked with partners and Enterprise customers to help them resolve their SharePoint Server operational and technical issues, as well as internal teams like the SPS Product Group in order to reproduce and resolve product bugs.

I really enjoyed troubleshooting hard issues, many times related to customer code, and that lead me into the world of debugging .Net and C++ applications with WinDBG, TTT and other tools.

I learnt a lot about all the related technologies in the MSFT on-premises world like SQL Server, AD, ADFS, ADCS, etc.
